# PCCM Job Offer Analysis

Job offers in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) are shrouded in ambiguity and inconsistency. This repository contains code and supporting materials for analyzing survey data on first academic job offers received by graduates between 2020 and 2025. The project explores both salary and non-salary components—including start-up packages, bonuses, and non-clinical FTE—for physician-scientists and clinician-educators, aiming to increase transparency in academic job negotiations. Scripts are provided for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization of key findings.
